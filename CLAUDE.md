This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a FastAPI-based chatbot that integrates with the Huntflow recruitment platform API and OpenAI's GPT-4 to provide AI-powered hiring analytics. The app provides real-time visualization of recruitment funnels and candidate statistics through a web interface.

## Absolute Rules

- DO NOT EVER DELETE INFORMATION FROM PROMPT UNLESS ASKED TO
- No mock or test data ever
- Simulated metrics must be clearly marked and based on real data patterns
- Always use actual database records as foundation for calculations
