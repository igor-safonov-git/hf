## Technical Achievements

### Universal Filtering Matrix
**Every entity can now be filtered by every other entity:**
- ✅ Applicants filtered by: recruiters, vacancies, sources, divisions, period
- ✅ Vacancies filtered by: recruiters, divisions, period, state
- ✅ Hires filtered by: recruiters, sources, vacancies, period
- ✅ Recruiters filtered by: divisions, performance metrics, period
- ✅ All entities support complex logical combinations

### Advanced Filtering Capabilities
```python
# Complex real-world example now supported:
filters = {
    "and": [
        {"period": "6 month"},
        {
            "or": [
                {"recruiters": "12345"},
                {"sources": {"operator": "in", "value": ["linkedin", "hh"]}}
            ]
        },
        {"vacancies": {"field": "state", "value": "open"}}
    ]
}
```
